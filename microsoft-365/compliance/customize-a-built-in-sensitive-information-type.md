# <a name="customize-a-built-in-sensitive-information-type"></a>自定义内置敏感信息类型

When looking for sensitive information in content, you need to describe that information in what's called a  *rule*  . Data loss prevention (DLP) includes rules for the most-common sensitive information types that you can use right away. To use these rules, you have to include them in a policy. You might find that you want to adjust these built-in rules to meet your organization's specific needs, and you can do that by creating a custom sensitive information type. This topic shows you how to customize the XML file that contains the existing rule collection to detect a wider range of potential credit-card information. 
  
You can take this example and apply it to other built-in sensitive information types. For a list of default sensitive information types and XML definitions, see [Sensitive information type entity definitions](sensitive-information-type-entity-definitions.md). 
  
## <a name="export-the-xml-file-of-the-current-rules"></a>导出当前规则的 XML 文件

必须[通过远程 PowerShell 连接到安全与合规中心](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps)，才能导出 XML。
  
1. In the PowerShell, type the following to display your organization's rules on screen. If you haven't created your own, you'll only see the default, built-in rules, labeled "Microsoft Rule Package."

```powershell
Get-DlpSensitiveInformationTypeRulePackage
```    
2. Store your organization's rules in a variable by typing the following. Storing something in a variable makes it easily available later in a format that works for remote PowerShell commands.

```powershell    
$ruleCollections = Get-DlpSensitiveInformationTypeRulePackage
```
    
3. Make a formatted XML file with all that data by typing the following. ( `Set-content` is the part of the cmdlet that writes the XML to the file.) 
    
```powershell
Set-Content -path C:\custompath\exportedRules.xml -Encoding Byte -Value $ruleCollections.SerializedClassificationRuleCollection
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you use the file location where your rule pack is actually stored.  `C:\custompath\` is a placeholder. 
  
## <a name="find-the-rule-that-you-want-to-modify-in-the-xml"></a>在 XML 中查找要修改的规则

The cmdlets above exported the entire *rule collection*, which includes the default rules we provide. Next you'll need to look specifically for the Credit Card Number rule that you want to modify. 
  
1. 使用文本编辑器打开在上一部分中导出的 XML 文件。
    
2. Scroll down to the  `<Rules>` tag, which is the start of the section that contains the DLP rules. Because this XML file contains the information for the entire rule collection, it contains other information at the top that you need to scroll past to get to the rules.
    
3. Look for *Func_credit_card* to find the Credit Card Number rule definition. In the XML, rule names can't contain spaces, so the spaces are usually replaced with underscores, and rule names are sometimes abbreviated. An example of this is the U.S. Social Security number rule, which is abbreviated "SSN." The Credit Card Number rule XML should look like the following code sample.
    
  ```xml
  <Entity id="50842eb7-edc8-4019-85dd-5a5c1f2bb085"
         patternsProximity="300" recommendedConfidence="85">
        <Pattern confidenceLevel="85">
         <IdMatch idRef="Func_credit_card" />
          <Any minMatches="1">
            <Match idRef="Keyword_cc_verification" />
            <Match idRef="Keyword_cc_name" />
            <Match idRef="Func_expiration_date" />
          </Any>
        </Pattern>
      </Entity>
  ```

Now that you have located the Credit Card Number rule definition in the XML, you can customize the rule's XML to meet your needs. For a refresher on the XML definitions, see the [Term glossary](#term-glossary) at the end of this topic.
  
## <a name="modify-the-xml-and-create-a-new-sensitive-information-type"></a>修改 XML 并新建敏感信息类型

First, you need to create a new sensitive information type because you can't directly modify the default rules. You can do a wide variety of things with custom sensitive information types, which are outlined in [Create a custom sensitive information type in Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](create-a-custom-sensitive-information-type-in-scc-powershell.md). For this example, we'll keep it simple and only remove corroborative evidence and add keywords to the Credit Card Number rule.
  
All XML rule definitions are built on the following general template. You need to copy and paste the Credit Card Number definition XML in the template, modify some values (notice the ". . ." placeholders in the following example), and then upload the modified XML as a new rule that can be used in policies.
  
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<RulePackage xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2011/mce">
  <RulePack id=". . .">
    <Version major="1" minor="0" build="0" revision="0" />
    <Publisher id=". . ." /> 
    <Details defaultLangCode=". . .">
      <LocalizedDetails langcode=" . . . ">
         <PublisherName>. . .</PublisherName>
         <Name>. . .</Name>
         <Description>. . .</Description>
      </LocalizedDetails>
    </Details>
  </RulePack>
  
 <Rules>
   <!-- Paste the Credit Card Number rule definition here.--> 
      <LocalizedStrings>
         <Resource idRef=". . .">
           <Name default="true" langcode=" . . . ">. . .</Name>
           <Description default="true" langcode=". . ."> . . .</Description>
         </Resource>
      </LocalizedStrings>
   </Rules>
</RulePackage>
```

Now, you have something that looks similar to the following XML. Because rule packages and rules are identified by their unique GUIDs, you need to generate two GUIDs: one for the rule package and one to replace the GUID for the Credit Card Number rule. The GUID for the entity ID in the following code sample is the one for our built-in rule definition, which you need to replace with a new one. There are several ways to generate GUIDs, but you can do it easily in PowerShell by typing **[guid]::NewGuid()**. 
  
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<RulePackage xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2011/mce">
  <RulePack id="8aac8390-e99f-4487-8d16-7f0cdee8defc">
    <Version major="1" minor="0" build="0" revision="0" />
    <Publisher id="8d34806e-cd65-4178-ba0e-5d7d712e5b66" />
    <Details defaultLangCode="en">
      <LocalizedDetails langcode="en">
        <PublisherName>Contoso Ltd.</PublisherName>
        <Name>Financial Information</Name>
        <Description>Modified versions of the Microsoft rule package</Description>
      </LocalizedDetails>
    </Details>
  </RulePack>
  
 <Rules>
    <Entity id="db80b3da-0056-436e-b0ca-1f4cf7080d1f"
       patternsProximity="300" recommendedConfidence="85">
      <Pattern confidenceLevel="85">
        <IdMatch idRef="Func_credit_card" />
        <Any minMatches="1">
          <Match idRef="Keyword_cc_verification" />
          <Match idRef="Keyword_cc_name" />
          <Match idRef="Func_expiration_date" />
        </Any>
      </Pattern>
    </Entity>
      <LocalizedStrings>
         <Resource idRef="db80b3da-0056-436e-b0ca-1f4cf7080d1f"> 
<!-- This is the GUID for the preceding Credit Card Number entity because the following text is for that Entity. -->
           <Name default="true" langcode="en-us">Modified Credit Card Number</Name>
           <Description default="true" langcode="en-us">Credit Card Number that looks for additional keywords, and another version of Credit Card Number that doesn't require keywords (but has a lower confidence level)</Description>
         </Resource>
      </LocalizedStrings>
   </Rules>
</RulePackage>
```

## <a name="remove-the-corroborative-evidence-requirement-from-a-sensitive-information-type"></a>从敏感信息类型中删除确证性证据要求

现在你具有可上传到安全与合规中心的新敏感信息类型，下一步是将规则设置得更加具体。 对规则进行修改，使其仅查找通过校验和但不需要额外的（佐证）证据（例如关键字）的 16 位数字。 为此，你需要删除查找佐证证据的 XML 部分。 佐证证据有助于减少误报。 在此情况下，信用卡号旁边通常有一些关键字或有过期日期。 如果你删除该证据，则还应通过调低 `confidenceLevel`（本示例中为 85），调整你认为你找到信用卡号的自信程度。
  
```xml
<Entity id="db80b3da-0056-436e-b0ca-1f4cf7080d1f" patternsProximity="300"
      <Pattern confidenceLevel="85">
        <IdMatch idRef="Func_credit_card" />
      </Pattern>
    </Entity>
```

## <a name="look-for-keywords-that-are-specific-to-your-organization"></a>查找组织专用关键字

You might want to require corroborative evidence but want different or additional keywords, and perhaps you want to change where to look for that evidence. You can adjust the  `patternsProximity` to expand or shrink the window for corroborative evidence around the 16-digit number. To add your own keywords, you need to define a keyword list and reference it within your rule. The following XML adds the keywords "company card" and "Contoso card" so that any message that contains those phrases within 150 characters of a credit card number will be identified as a credit card number.
  
```xml
<Rules>
<! -- Modify the patternsProximity to be "150" rather than "300." -->
    <Entity id="db80b3da-0056-436e-b0ca-1f4cf7080d1f" patternsProximity="150" recommendedConfidence="85">
      <Pattern confidenceLevel="85">
        <IdMatch idRef="Func_credit_card" />
        <Any minMatches="1">
          <Match idRef="Keyword_cc_verification" />
          <Match idRef="Keyword_cc_name" />
<!-- Add the following XML, which references the keywords at the end of the XML sample. -->
          <Match idRef="My_Additional_Keywords" />
          <Match idRef="Func_expiration_date" />
        </Any>
      </Pattern>
    </Entity>
<!-- Add the following XML, and update the information inside the <Term> tags with the keywords that you want to detect. -->
    <Keyword id="My_Additional_Keywords">
      <Group matchStyle="word">
        <Term caseSensitive="false">company card</Term>
        <Term caseSensitive="false">Contoso card</Term>
      </Group>
    </Keyword>
```

## <a name="upload-your-rule"></a>上传规则

要上载您的规则，需执行以下操作：
  
1. Save it as an .xml file with Unicode encoding. This is important because the rule won't work if the file is saved with a different encoding.
    
2. [使用远程 PowerShell 连接到安全与合规中心](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799771)。
    
3. 在 PowerShell 中，键入下面的代码。

```powershell    
New-DlpSensitiveInformationTypeRulePackage -FileData (Get-Content -Path "C:\custompath\MyNewRulePack.xml" -Encoding Byte).
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you use the file location where your rule pack is actually stored.  `C:\custompath\` is a placeholder. 
  
4. 若要确认，请先键入“Y”，再按 Enter****。
5. 请键入以下内容，验证确保你的新规则已上传且显示名称：

```powershell
Get-DlpSensitiveInformationType
```

To start using the new rule to detect sensitive information, you need to add the rule to a DLP policy. To learn how to add the rule to a policy, see [Create a DLP policy from a template](create-a-dlp-policy-from-a-template.md).
  
## <a name="term-glossary"></a>术语表

下面您在此过程中遇到的术语的定义。
  
|**术语**|**定义**|
|:-----|:-----|
|实体|Entities are what we call sensitive information types, such as credit card numbers. Each entity has a unique GUID as its ID. If you copy a GUID and search for it in the XML, you'll find the XML rule definition and all the localized translations of that XML rule. You can also find this definition by locating the GUID for the translation and then searching for that GUID.|
|函数|The XML file references  `Func_credit_card`, which is a function in compiled code. Functions are used to run complex regexes and verify that checksums match for our built-in rules.) Because this happens in the code, some of the variables don't appear in the XML file.|
|IdMatch|这是尝试匹配的模式的标识符，例如信用卡号。|
|关键字列表|The XML file also references  `keyword_cc_verification` and  `keyword_cc_name`, which are lists of keywords from which we are looking for matches within the  `patternsProximity` for the entity. These aren't currently displayed in the XML.|
|模式|模式包含敏感类型所查找内容的列表。 这包括关键字、正则表达式和内部函数，它们用于执行验证校验和等任务。 敏感信息类型可能具有多个模式，每个模式均具有唯一的可信度。 这在创建敏感信息类型时非常有用：当它找到确定证据时，返回高可信度；当未找到确定证据时，则返回较低的可信度。|
|模式可信度|This is the level of confidence that the DLP engine found a match. This level of confidence is associated with a match for the pattern if the pattern's requirements are met. This is the confidence measure you should consider when using Exchange mail flow rules (also known as transport rules).|
|patternsProximity|`patternsProximity` 是指在查找信用卡号模式时，在与信用卡号多近的范围内查找确证性证据。|
|recommendedConfidence|This is the confidence level we recommend for this rule. The recommended confidence applies to entities and affinities. For entities, this number is never evaluated against the  `confidenceLevel` for the pattern. It's merely a suggestion to help you choose a confidence level if you want to apply one. For affinities, the  `confidenceLevel` of the pattern must be higher than the  `recommendedConfidence` number for a mail flow rule action to be invoked. The  `recommendedConfidence` is the default confidence level used in mail flow rules that invokes an action. If you want, you can manually change the mail flow rule to be invoked based off the pattern's confidence level, instead.|
