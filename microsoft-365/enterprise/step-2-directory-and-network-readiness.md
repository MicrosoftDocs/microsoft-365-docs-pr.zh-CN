<span data-ttu-id="04b11-118">如果你的组织已使用 Office 365、Exchange Online、Microsoft Intune 或其他 Microsoft Online 服务，表明你已在使用 Azure Active Directory。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-118">If your organization already uses Office 365, Exchange Online, Microsoft Intune, or other Microsoft Online services, the good news is you are already using Azure Active Directory.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="04b11-119">如果是这样的话，只需确保你的桌面部署目标用户位于 Azure Active Directory 中，并且已分配许可证。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-119">If you are, you just need to ensure that the users you are targeting for desktop deployment are in your Azure Active Directory and that licenses have been assigned.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="04b11-120">如果当前未使用 Azure Active Directory，则有[大量资源](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/)可帮助你进行设置。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-120">If you are not currently using Azure Active Directory, there are [numerous resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/) to help you set it up.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="04b11-121">你也可以通过 Microsoft FastTrack 获得个性化帮助，这是许可证的权益。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-121">You may well qualify for personalized assistance via Microsoft FastTrack, as part of your license.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="04b11-122">可以在[此处](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com)查看有关 Microsoft FastTrack 的更多信息。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-122">You can check out more about Microsoft FastTrack [here](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com).</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="04b11-125">规划部署时，必须考虑带宽要求。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-125">You must consider bandwidth requirements when planning your deployments.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="04b11-126">部署过程中有三个主要部分会对网络产生影响：电脑映像、软件更新、用户个性化设置。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-126">There are three main components in a deployment that will have an impact on your network – PC imaging, software updates, and user personalization.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="04b11-127">这意味着初始迁移的每台电脑空间可能超过 20 GB，并且每台电脑每月通常需要 1 GB 或更大空间才能保持最新状态。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-127">Between them, this can mean in excess of 20 GB per PC for the initial migration, and often 1 GB or more per month per PC to stay up-to-date.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="04b11-128">我们首先探讨这三个主要部分的要求：</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-128">Let’s start by exploring the requirements of each of these three main components:</span></span>

### <a name="pc-imaging"></a><span data-ttu-id="04b11-129">电脑成像</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-129">PC Imaging</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="04b11-130">对于没有自定义项的 Windows 映像，通常应规划每台电脑 3 GB 的空间，而对于包含应用的自定义映像，可能需要留出 6 GB 或更大空间。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-130">For Windows Images with no customization you should plan typically for 3GB per PC, while for customized images with apps you may need to allow 6GB, or more.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="04b11-131">可能还需要考虑驱动程序包，可以是每台电脑几百 MB，有时高达 1 GB。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-131">You may also need to consider Driver packages; these can be a few hundred megabytes per PC, sometimes up to 1GB.</span></span>

### <a name="software-updates"></a><span data-ttu-id="04b11-132">软件更新</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="04b11-132">Software Updates</span></span>
